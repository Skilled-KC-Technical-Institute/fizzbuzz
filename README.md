# FizzBuzz
### For Lab 2 you will be creating a program called FizzBuzz.

* Write a web page that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 with the following exceptions:

    * For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number

    * For the multiples of five print "Buzz"

    * For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz"

* Print the numbers to an HTML page (this is a great opportunity for fun styling)

* You should take advantage of looping, logical operators, and switch or if else statements.

* The code should be well documented with comments, have good code structure, and following naming conventions.

* Push your code to your repository


Pseudo Code

Print 1-100 in console
If the number is divisible by 3 and 5 print FizzBuzz
If the number is divisible by 3 print Fizz
if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz
otherwise print the number
